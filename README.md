### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on LLM and AIGC applications.

Previously, I learned Computer Graphics, Visualization and Differentiable Rendering.

For fun, I am exploring fusing artificial intelligence with spatial computing. And we have some plans!

Below is the map of projects I am trying to explore. Stay tuned! Or join me ðŸš€
